- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lordkaito
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general, all kind of languages, technologies etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, improving my HTML and CSS knowledge, learning some about terminal (linux) and more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can. I might not be the most intelligent right know, but if someone trusts me I can do a lot, I'm sure about that
- 📫 You can text me via Twitter (@cespedesisai), email (cespedesisai88@gmail.com) or via discord (lordkaito#9910)
